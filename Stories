Thanks for sharing the stakeholder requirements. Based on these requirements, here are some user stories that you
can create in ZenHub:

  1. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to create a product in the catalog so that I can add new products to the
website.
  2. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to retrieve a product from the catalog so that 1 can view its details.
  3. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to update a product in the catalog so that I can make changes to its
details.
  4. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to delete a product from the catalog so that I can remove products that
are no longer available.
5, As a stakeholder, I want to be able to "Like" a product in the catalog so that customers can indicate their
preference for certain products.
  6. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to 'T)islike" a product in the catalog so that customers can indicate their
dislike for certain products.
  7. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to list all products in the catalog so that customers can view all available
products.
  8. As a stakeholder, I want to be able to query a subset of products in the catalog so that customers can search
for specific products based on certain criteria.
  9. As a stakeholder, I want the backend product catalog for the e-commerce website hosted on cloud environment with automated deployments so that it is easy and efficient to deploy new changes and updates.
